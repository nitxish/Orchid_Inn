The Hotel Room Booking App is a mobile application built using XML (Front-end), Java (Back-end), and Google Firebase (Database), designed for both users and hotel admins. Users can search hotels, book multiple rooms, view room photos, receive booking details via email, check past stays, and cancel bookings. Hotel admins can log in with a unique Hotel ID and Password, add rooms, mark rooms as under maintenance, and manage customer bookings. This project was developed as part of my final year project to streamline hotel booking and management.
